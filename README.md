# MobileData-Visualization

## Project Description : 

Have you ever wondered where to find an electric Vélib’ in Paris ? Or which stations are always full — or always empty ?
In this project, we analyze bike-sharing data from Paris to identify usage patterns, availability trends, and station performance. With Python and data visualization tools, we turn numbers into insights to better understand urban mobility.
