# MobileData-Visualization

![Teaser](Asset/teaser.png)

## Project Description : 

Have you ever wondered where to find an electric Vélib’ in Paris ? Or which stations are always full — or always empty ?
In this project, we analyze bike-sharing data from Paris to identify usage patterns, availability trends, and station performance. With Python and data visualization tools, we turn numbers into insights to better understand urban mobility.

## Our objectives :

- To observe the dynamics of Velib in Paris.
  - Why ? : It is one of the most ecological transport in paris.
- To make some conclusions on our analysis:
  - Which stations are the most crowded, at which time of the day...
- To understand how Velib's are used throughout the day
