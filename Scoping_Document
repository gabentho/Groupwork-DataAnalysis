## Understanding Vélib’ Usage in Paris: Availability, Usage Patterns & Station Performance

First, Velib is a company from the government that allows paris citizen to use electric or normal bikes to move in paris by means of a subscription.

We were three to work on this project : 
    - Gabriel Enthoven
    - Yanis Montacer 
    - Gabriel Gaslain

### Context : 

Vélib’, the public bike-sharing system in Paris, plays a key role in sustainable urban mobility. Understanding how bikes are distributed and used across the city can help improve both the user experience and operational efficiency. This project aims to analyze real-time and historical availability data to reveal usage trends and optimize system performance.

### Objectives : 

### Project Scope:

	•	Analysis of bike availability data within Paris
	•	Merging and cleaning hourly datasets for time-based analysis
	•	Data visualizations showing key trends and insights


### Dataset & Sources :

Dataset:
	    Hourly CSV files containing station-level bike availability
	    Final merged dataset: Velib.csv
Source:
	    Open government data from [Click Here](https://transport.data.gouv.fr/datasets/velib-velos-et-bornes-disponibilite-temps-reel)

### Methodology
Data Collection:
	•	Gather multiple CSV files captured at different hours of the day
	•	Merge files into one consistent dataset
Data Cleaning:
	•	Handle missing values and inconsistencies
	•	Format data for time-based analysis
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
	•	Compute descriptive statistics
	•	Identify general trends and irregularities
Visualization:
	•	Use heatmaps, bar charts, and line plots
	•	Highlight station activity and usage over time


### Tools & Technologies :
Language: Python, Java Script, HTML, CSS
Libraries:
	pandas for data manipulation
	matplotlib and seaborn for visualization
    numpy 
    geopandas for a map display
    contextily
    shapely.geometry
Environment: Jupyter Notebook

### Deliverables :
	•	Cleaned and merged dataset (Velib.csv)
	•	Jupyter Notebook with full data analysis and code
	•   Full working website made with html,css and javascript deployed from github pages or locally on a server
