22/02
	•	Initialized the GitHub repository and created the README.md file.
	•	Installed GitHub Desktop and attempted to synchronize local changes with the remote repository.

03/03
	•	Uploaded our initial Python scripts and the first CSV dataset to the repository.

08/03
	•	Added two team members as collaborators on the GitHub project to facilitate teamwork and version control.

10/03
	•	Completed a preliminary cleaning of the dataset. Although the dataset was relatively clean upon download, we reviewed and confirmed its structure.
	Key decison:
		•	Decided to switch datasets due to insufficient data volume in the original one.
		•	Removed the last column, which contained only NaN values.

	•	Found a new dataset, updated the source in the README file, and made initial edits:
	•	Edited some columns that were meaningless, such as “Capacité de la station”, which mostly contained zeros.

11/03
	•	Performed deeper dataset cleaning:
	•	Removed stations that were inactive or non-functional.
	•	Dropped all stations with a capacity of 0.

13/03
	Big Key decision in our analysis:
		•	Collected multiple datasets captured at different times on the same day to enable time-based analysis.
		•	Our goal was to merge these hourly datasets into a comprehensive one for temporal visualizations using D3.js.
	
	•	Faced technical challenges while trying to use Observable to render our visualizations.

14/03
	•	Successfully merged all time-stamped datasets into a single, clean dataset ready for analysis and visualization.
	•	Added new columns such as "hour", "arrondissement", and "Densité de la station" to enhance the clarity and usefulness of our analysis.

15/03
	•	Wrote and tested new Python scripts to further explore and analyze the merged dataset.

17/03
	Key decision:
		•	Realized that using Observable was not necessary for implementing D3.js visualizations.
		•	Decided to stop using Observable and focus on deploying our visualizations directly via GitHub Pages.

20/03
	Key decision :
		•	Held a team work session at the EM Lyon Makersboard.
		•	Selected the types of D3.js graphs we would use for the project and began implementing them.

21/03
	•	Continued developing and refining each D3.js graph, assigning responsibilities within the team.

22/03
	•	Integrated a map of Paris into the project and plotted all Vélib’ stations on it.
	•	Made the map fully interactive, allowing users to explore the stations dynamically.

23/03
	•	Added a new graph that helps us understand the distribution of Vélib’ stations across Paris.
	•	Added another graph showing the number of electric and non-electric bikes in the top 10 busiest stations in the city.

24/03
    •   Started to edit the HTML code 

25/03
	•	Worked together in class to refine the project.
	•	Attempted to add a scatterplot to visualize relationships between key variables.

26/03
	Key decision for our website visualisation:
		•	Brainstormed ideas for a final visualization.
		•	Started working on the visual design of our website, as planned from the beginning of the project.
		•	Wrote CSS code to enhance the interface and improve the user experience.
    •   Continue to edit the HTML file 

27/03
	•	Added a new line chart to visualize the distribution of Vélib’ stations across Paris.
	•	Continued working on the visual design of our website, focusing on the CSS code especially.

28/03
	•	Continued refining the visual design of our website, focusing on the CSS code.
	•	Tried to add a favicon working on chrome but not on safari.
	• 	Added a thumbnail and a teaser image to the repository

29/03
	•	Still working on the CSS and trying to make the website more fluid.
