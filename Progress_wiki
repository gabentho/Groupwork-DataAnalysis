22/02
	•	Initialized the GitHub repository and created the README.md file.
	•	Installed GitHub Desktop and attempted to synchronize local changes with the remote repository.

03/03
	•	Uploaded our initial Python scripts and the first CSV dataset to the repository.

08/03
	•	Added two team members as collaborators on the GitHub project to facilitate teamwork and version control.

10/03
	•	Completed a preliminary cleaning of the dataset. Although the dataset was relatively clean upon download, we reviewed and confirmed its structure.
	•	Decided to switch datasets due to insufficient data volume in the original one.
	•	Found a new dataset, updated the source in the README file, and made initial edits:
	    •	Removed the last column, which contained only NaN values.
        •   Edited some columns that were meaningless like "Capacité de la station" there were almost only zeros in this column
        • We also added some columns like these ones "hour","arrondissement", "Densité de la station" etc

11/03
	•	Performed deeper dataset cleaning:
	•	Removed stations that were inactive or non-functional.
	•	Dropped all stations with a capacity of 0.

13/03
	•	Collected multiple datasets captured at different times on the same day to enable time-based analysis.
	•	Our goal was to merge these hourly datasets into a comprehensive one for temporal visualizations using D3.js.
	•	Faced technical challenges while trying to use Observable to render our visualizations.

14/03
	•	Successfully merged all time-stamped datasets into a single, clean dataset ready for analysis and visualization.

15/03
	•	Wrote and tested new Python scripts to further explore and analyze the merged dataset.

17/03
	•	Realized that using Observable was not necessary for implementing D3.js visualizations.
	•	Decided to stop using Observable and focus on deploying our visualizations directly within our web project.

20/03
	•	Held a team work session at the EM Lyon Makersboard.
	•	Selected the types of D3.js graphs we will use for the project and began implementing them.

21/03
	•	Continued development and refinement of each D3.js graph, assigning responsibilities within the team.

22/03
	•	Integrated a map of Paris into the project and plotted all Vélib’ stations on it.
	•	Made the map fully interactive, allowing users to explore the stations dynamically.

25/03
	•	Worked together in class to refine the project.
	•	Attempted to add a scatterplot to visualize relationships between key variables.

26/03
    •   Been thinking together to add a last visualisation 
	•	Began working on the visual design of our website, as planned from the beginning of the project.
	•	Started writing CSS code to improve the look and feel of the interface.
